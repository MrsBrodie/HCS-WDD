				<h2> Adopt a tiger </h2>
				<p><a href="animals.html">Go back to the animals page</a></p>
				
				<p>At Springfield Zoo, our most famous animal is Jacob the Sumatran Tiger!</p>
				<p>Tigers are globally listed as “endangered”; the Sumatran sub-species is listed as “critically endangered.” Wild tigers are hunted to meet the demands of the $20 billion a year illegal wildlife market.</p>
				When you adopt one of our Sumatran tigers you will be helping to pay for the care, feeding and general well-being of that animal for one year. The costs of running a zoo are enormous and every penny contributed makes a huge difference.</p>
				<p>Adoption costs £49.99 and if you sign-up you will receive:</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:dash;list-style-position:inside">
				<li>A certificate of adoption</li>
				<li>A picture of your chosen animal</li>
				<li>Five complimentary adult tickets to Springfield Zoo</li>
				<li>A fact sheet about your animal</li>
				</ul>
