				<p>We are one of the most exciting and popular zoos in the United Kingdom. At Springfield Zoo you will see a wide variety of species and animals from all over the world.</p>
				<p>Our website will give you information on the history of the zoo and a list of animals you can visit. You will also find a daily animal profile, information on how to adopt a tiger and pages for booking school excursions and birthday parties.</p>
				<p>At Springfield Zoo, we care deeply about our animals and their natural habitats. We work closely with animal and conservation charities and our adoption page provides more information on how you can save the lives of animals and protect their environments.</p>
				<p>We hope you enjoy our website and if you have any questions, feel free to get in touch with us.</p>
