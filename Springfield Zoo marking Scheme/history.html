				<div style="padding:10px">
					<p>On June 16th 1983, Springfield Zoo was officially opened by its founder, Violet Rose.</p>
					
					<p>Inspired by her marine-biologist mother, Violet grew up as an animal enthusiast and conservationist and by the age of 25 she had decided to set up a small zoo to create a better future for local wildlife.</p>

					<p>The zoo was initially set up in a local park in the west of Springfield and slowly expanded until it relocated to the south-central area of the city in 1992.</p>

					<p>Funding was initially aided by the local council and charitable donations and within a year of opening it was a successful business that was financially stable. Soon after it quickly became one of Springfield’s top attractions for tourists.</p>

					<p>Today the zoo welcomes over 500000 visitors a year and provides a home for 1’254 animals and 147 different species (or subspecies of) marsupials, carnivores, primates, ungulates, small mammals, birds of prey, water birds, crocodilians, turtles, lizards, snakes, amphibians, fish and invertebrates.</p>

					<p>Springfield Zoo started with 9 members of staff and now employs over 200 people and is a vital part of the local economy.</p>

					<p>The zoo is proud to offer education programs and conservation efforts and is working tirelessly to save species regionally and worldwide.</p>
