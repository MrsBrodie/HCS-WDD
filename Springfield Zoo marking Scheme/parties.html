				<p>Celebrate the big day with friends and family in one of our private party locations throughout the zoo and we’ll help you create your unique two-hour birthday bash. Valid zoo membership or zoo admission tickets are required for all party guests, which allows them the opportunity to visit all the amazing animals before and after your party.</p>

				<h3>Numbers and cost</h3>
