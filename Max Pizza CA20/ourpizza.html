			<h3>What makes an Italian Pizza?</h3>
			<p>Pizza has been a staple of Italian heritage and culture dating back to the 16th century. From there, it permeated the world, interpreted and served in a variety of ways and enjoyed by nearly everyone. Italian pizzas are not served as a slice, but most commonly as a whole pie. Often when people order a pizza, they are expecting to share. However, in Italy, each person will get their own massive pie and trade pieces around the table.</p>
			<p>The crust is one of the most important components of the meal and is traditionally thin but has a fluffy consistency. Within the crust lies the characteristic flavour and exceptional texture found solely in Italian pizza. The crust is hand-stretched and cooked at extremely high temperatures in a wood-fired oven to achieve that impeccable finished quality.</p>
			<p>The sauce is the next important factor and is made from peeled tomatoes, grown in rich Italian soil and blended with a variety of well-portioned herbs.</p>
